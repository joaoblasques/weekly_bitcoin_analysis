## DETAILED ANALYSIS

### 1. HALVING CYCLE ANALYSIS

**Historical Pattern:**
- 1st cycle (2012): Peak at 367 days post-halving
- 2nd cycle (2016): Peak at 526 days post-halving
- 3rd cycle (2020): Peak at 546 days post-halving
- **Average:** 480 days | **Trend:** Lengthening by ~80 days per cycle

**Current Cycle Status:**
- **Days Post-Halving:** 607 (as of Dec 17, 2025)
- **Time Remaining to Base Case Peak:** ~280 days (9.1 months)
- **Projected Peak:** ~890 days post-halving (Sept 25, 2026)

**Why Extended Timeline (+5 days vs last week):**
- Breakdown below $87K suggests consolidation phase extending
- Increased volatility and fear typically prolong base-building periods
- Market needs more time to absorb selling pressure and rebuild confidence
- Historical precedent: Mid-cycle corrections often last 8-12 weeks (currently week 8)

**Confidence Decrease (-6%):**
- Technical breakdown below key support reduces conviction in base case timing
- Increased probability of extended consolidation or deeper correction
- Bear case probability rose from 15% to 25% (per last week's framework)
- Base case intact but requires $80K to hold; break = major reassessment

---

### 2. ON-CHAIN METRICS ANALYSIS

**MVRV Ratio (Market Value to Realized Value):**
- **Current:** Estimated 1.85-1.95 (down from 2.1 last week due to price decline)
- **Historical cycle peaks:** 3.5-4.0+
- **Peak target:** 3.0-3.5 for this cycle
- **Assessment:** Price decline bringing MVRV back to healthier accumulation levels
- **Distance to peak:** MVRV needs to increase by ~55-80% to reach overheated territory

**NUPL (Net Unrealized Profit/Loss):**
- **Current:** Estimated 0.40-0.45 (down from 0.45-0.50 last week)
- **Euphoria territory:** >0.75
- **Fear territory:** <0.25
- **Assessment:** Moving toward fear but not capitulation; holders sitting on moderate profits
- **Historical context:** Readings in 0.35-0.45 range typical of mid-cycle corrections

**Exchange Whale Ratio & Flows:**
- **December Accumulation:** 47,600 BTC absorbed through Dec 10 (trend likely continuing)
- **Current Week:** Data pending, but fear typically drives more whale accumulation
- **Long-term Holders:** 74% of circulating supply (likely stable or increasing)
- **Exchange Balance Trend:** Continued outflows expected (smart money buying dips)
- **Price Dip Context:** $86K represents attractive entry for institutions with longer horizons

**Assessment:** On-chain metrics still support mid-cycle thesis, but price action testing conviction. If whale accumulation continues despite breakdown, bullish long-term. If accumulation reverses to distribution, bear case probability rises to 40%+.

---

### 3. ETF FLOWS & INSTITUTIONAL DEMAND

**Week of December 10-17 (Estimated):**
- **Weekly Net Flow:** Likely continued outflows (-$100M to -$300M estimated)
- **Context:** Post-Fed selling, year-end rebalancing, tax-loss harvesting
- **BlackRock IBIT:** Outflow streak likely extending (7th consecutive week probable)

**2025 Year-to-Date:**
- **Cumulative:** Still positive $20B+ YTD despite Q4 weakness
- **Q4 2025:** Negative quarter continues (-$0.5B to -$1.0B total estimated)

**Interpretation:**
The price breakdown exacerbates near-term ETF pressure:
1. **Tax-Loss Harvesting Accelerates:** Holders locking in losses before Dec 31
2. **Institutional Rebalancing:** Funds reducing crypto exposure at year-end
3. **Momentum Selling:** Technical breakdown triggering algorithm-driven redemptions
4. **Year-End Liquidity Crunch:** Typical December pattern amplified this year

**Bullish Counter-Arguments:**
- YTD flows remain massively positive (~$20B+ structural bid)
- Tax-loss selling ends Dec 31; Jan typically sees reversal
- ETFs create institutional cost basis; large holders accumulating at lower prices
- February-March historically strong months for crypto (Q1 buying resumes)

**Assessment:** Near-term ETF headwinds intensifying, but structural bull case intact. Expect flows to reverse positive in Q1 2026 as tax-loss selling ends and Fed easing effects compound. Current weakness creating better entry points.

---

### 4. MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS

**Federal Reserve Policy:**
- **Current Target Range:** 3.50-3.75% (after Dec 10 cut)
- **2026 Outlook:** 1-2 additional cuts projected (terminal rate 3.0-3.25%)
- **Market Reaction:** "Sell the news" post-rate cut typical; doesn't negate dovish trajectory
- **Timeline to Peak:** 9 months of cumulative easing by Sept 2026 = supportive

**Why Bitcoin Sold Off Despite Rate Cut:**
1. **Priced In:** 97% probability pre-meeting meant no surprise
2. **Hawkish Dots:** Fed's 2026 dot plot showed only 1-2 cuts (market wanted more)
3. **Powell's Caution:** Chair signaled "no rush" to cut further
4. **Strong Dollar:** DXY rebounded post-FOMC, headwind for risk assets
5. **Year-End Dynamics:** Tax/rebalancing pressures overwhelmed dovish policy

**Inflation & Economic Outlook:**
- **Core PCE:** 2.9% (sticky inflation limits aggressive cuts)
- **Labor Market:** Still resilient, reducing urgency for Fed easing
- **2026 Trajectory:** Gradual easing likely, but slower than bulls hoped

**USD Index (DXY):**
- **Current Level:** Estimated 99-100 (strengthening post-FOMC)
- **Correlation with BTC:** Inverse; stronger dollar = Bitcoin headwind
- **Outlook:** Likely peaks Q1 2026, then weakens as Fed easing continues (bullish BTC H2 2026)

**Assessment:** Macro backdrop remains supportive medium-term (Fed easing, global liquidity expansion) but near-term dollar strength and cautious Fed posture creating headwinds. By Q3 2026 (predicted peak), cumulative easing should drive Bitcoin higher. Current weakness represents "buy the dip" opportunity for patient capital.

---

### 5. SENTIMENT ANALYSIS

**Fear & Greed Index:**
- **Last Week:** 22-26 (Extreme Fear)
- **Current (Estimated):** 15-20 (Deeper Extreme Fear)
- **Historical Context:** Readings below 20 are rare and mark capitulation-level fear
- **Interpretation:** Peak fear = contrarian buy signal; retail fully washed out

**Retail vs Institutional Sentiment:**
- **Retail:** Panic selling, tax-loss harvesting, year-end liquidations
- **Institutional:** Likely accumulating at lower prices (whale data from Dec 1-10 showed aggressive buying)
- **Divergence:** When retail capitulates and institutions buy = classic mid-cycle bottom setup

**Social Media & Search Trends:**
- Bitcoin search interest likely declining (disinterest = bullish contrarian signal)
- Social sentiment maximally bearish (narratives of "cycle over," "October was the top")
- Lack of FOMO and presence of FUD = significant upside runway remains

**Assessment:** Sentiment at historically attractive levels for accumulation. Extreme fear (15-20) has marked major buying opportunities in every past cycle. Current fear arguably overdone relative to fundamentals (Fed easing, whale accumulation, mid-cycle position). Contrarian signal strength: **High**.

---

### 6. PRICE PROJECTION MODEL

**Base Case Calculation (Updated):**

Starting point (current): $86,780

Historical cycle gains from mid-cycle low:
- 2013 cycle: 5.2x from mid-cycle low
- 2017 cycle: 3.1x from mid-cycle correction
- 2021 cycle: 2.4x from mid-cycle correction
- **Trend:** Diminishing returns (~-40% each cycle)

**Conservative model (1.9-2.1x from current level):**
- Low estimate: $86,780 × 1.9 = $164,882
- High estimate: $86,780 × 2.1 = $182,238

**Adjusted for institutional dampening (-10%):**
- Low: $164,882 × 0.90 = $148,394
- High: $182,238 × 0.90 = $164,014

**Adjusted for Fed dovish scenario (+5%):**
- Base: $156,204 × 1.05 = $164,014

**Final Base Case:** $165,000 (rounded, accounting for Fed easing offsetting current weakness)

**Rationale for -$3K Decrease from Last Week:**
1. Starting point $6,720 lower ($93,500 → $86,780) reduces mathematical endpoint
2. Technical breakdown increases downside risk, reducing bull case probability
3. Extended consolidation likely means slower ascent to peak (more time = lower multiple)
4. Bear case probability rising from 15% to 25% lowers probability-weighted expected value
5. Offset: Extreme fear creates better risk/reward, but base case target remains conservative

## PREDICTION BREAKDOWN

### BASE CASE (52% Probability) ⬇️ -6% from last week
**Date:** September 25, 2026 (±3 weeks, 5 days later than last week)
**Price:** $165,000 ($147,000-$183,000 range)
**Days Post-Halving:** ~892 days

**Reasoning:**
- Fed rate cuts cumulative effect by Q3 2026 (dovish trajectory intact)
- Current correction extends consolidation phase by 1-2 weeks (Sept 20 → Sept 25)
- MVRV correction to 1.85-1.95 healthier for sustained rally (less frothy)
- Extreme fear sentiment creates spring-loaded setup for Q1 2026 recovery
- $80K support critical: hold = base case intact; break = bear case activated
- ETF flows expected to reverse positive Q1 2026 (tax-loss selling ends, institutional buying resumes)
- Whale accumulation likely accelerating at these prices (smart money buying panic)

**Confidence Decrease (-6%):** Technical breakdown below $87K reduces near-term conviction. Base case requires $80K to hold. If $80K breaks with volume, bear case probability rises to 40% and base case drops to 35-40%.

---

### BULL CASE (23% Probability) ⬇️ -4% from last week
**Date:** December 2026 - January 2027
**Price:** $210,000-$240,000

**Catalysts (with quantified impact):**
1. **Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Legislation:** Federal bill passes in H1 2026 (+$40-60K, accelerates peak by 2 months)
2. **Fed Cuts More Aggressively:** Recession forces emergency cuts, terminal rate hits 2.0% (+$30-45K, accelerates by 1-2 months)
3. **Supply Shock Intensifies:** Whale + ETF accumulation absorbs 200%+ of issuance (+$50-70K, accelerates by 2 months)
4. **Major Corporate Adoption Wave:** 3+ Fortune 100 companies announce BTC treasury (+$35-50K, accelerates by 1 month)
5. **Dollar Collapse:** DXY breaks below 90, global fiat crisis (+$60-90K, timing unpredictable)

**Why Probability Decreased (-4%):**
- Technical breakdown raises odds of extended consolidation over explosive rally
- Year-end weakness delays recovery timeline
- Lower starting point ($86K vs $93K) requires larger percentage gains
- Hawkish Fed dots reduce probability of aggressive easing

---

### BEAR CASE (25% Probability) ⬆️ +10% from last week
**Date:** Q1 2026 peak already occurred OR extended bear market
**Price:** $95,000-$115,000 (if October 2025 wasn't peak) OR deeper lows ($65K-$75K if bearish)

**Risk Factors (with quantified impact):**
- **October 2025 Peak Was THE Top:** Current view is wrong, cycle already over (immediate, -$20K from current)
- **Break Below $80K Confirms Bear:** Cascade selling to $65-75K (-$12-20K, immediate)
- **Recession Triggers Q1 2026:** Credit crisis, mass risk-off liquidations (+6 months delay, -$40K)
- **ETF Redemptions Accelerate:** Institutional exit continues Q1 2026 (+3-6 months, -$30K)
- **Regulatory Crackdown:** Major economy restricts institutional participation (+6 months, -$35K)
- **Whale Accumulation Reverses:** Smart money exits, distribution phase begins (+3 months, -$40K)

**Why Probability Increased (+10%):**
- **$87K Support Broken:** Last week's framework stated break = bear case 25% (activated)
- **Sequential Support Failures:** $92K then $87K broken; $80K next critical test
- **Technical Damage:** Downtrend accelerating, momentum bearish
- **Year-End Selling:** Could push below $80K before Jan reversal
- **Whale Data Unknown:** If December accumulation reversed, bear case strengthens significantly

**Bear Case Now Likely If:**
- BTC breaks below $80K with volume (>$1B daily liquidations)
- MVRV declines below 1.7
- Whale accumulation reverses to distribution
- ETF outflows accelerate to >$500M/week

   - Probability: 15-20%

---

## WHAT COULD MAKE PRICE HIGHER THAN $165K?

1. **Tax-Loss Reversal + Institutional FOMO (Q1 2026)** (+$30-50K)
   - January buying reverses Dec selling
   - Institutions front-run Q1 fiscal year rebalancing
   - Probability: 35-40%

2. **Supply Shock from Whale Accumulation** (+$40-70K)
   - Whales bought 47.6K BTC through Dec 10; likely adding more at $86K
   - If accumulation rate continues 6+ months, liquidity crisis ensues
   - Probability: 30-35%

3. **Strategic Reserve Cascade** (+$80-120K)
   - Multiple nations announce simultaneously
   - Global FOMO buying wave
   - Probability: 8-12%

4. **Retail Mania Returns** (+$40-60K)
   - Fear & Greed flips to Extreme Greed (>80)

   - Bear market already begun
   - Current "mid-cycle thesis" is wrong
   - Probability: 15-20% (up from 10-12% last week)

2. **Break Below $80K → Cascade to $65-75K** (-$12-22K from current)
   - Loss of critical support triggers algorithmic selling
   - Forced ETF redemptions, margin calls
   - Probability: 20-25%

3. **Recession + Credit Crisis** (-$20-40K from eventual peak)
   - Economic collapse in 2026
   - Risk-off across all assets
   - Probability: 20-25%

4. **Extended Consolidation → Lower Peak** (-$30-50K)
   - Cycle extends to 2027-2028 but with diminished gains
   - Institutional dampening effect stronger than expected
   - Probability: 25-30%

---

## KEY LEVELS TO MONITOR

### Support Levels
| Level | Significance | Action If Broken |
|-------|--------------|------------------|
| **$86,780** | Current price; holding here is crucial | Any further decline = test $80K imminent |
| **$82,000-84,000** | Secondary support zone before $80K | Break = high probability $80K test within days |
| **$80,400** | **CRITICAL** November low, institutional cost basis, make-or-break level | **Break with volume = bear case activated (40% probability)** |
| **$75,000** | Long-term holder realized price support | Break = extended bear market very likely (60% bear case) |
| **$70,000** | Deep retracement; would challenge mid-cycle thesis | Break = cycle likely over; reassess entirely |

### Resistance Levels
| Level | Significance | Action If Reclaimed |
|-------|--------------|---------------------|
| **$87,000** | Just-broken support; now resistance | Reclaim = short-term relief; doesn't confirm reversal |
| **$92,000** | Previous consolidation floor | Reclaim = base case confidence rises back to 55-58% |
| **$97,100** | Key level from 2 weeks ago | Reclaim = bullish continuation confirmed |
| **$100,000** | Psychological level | Reclaim by end of Q1 2026 = base case strongly validated |
| **$110,000** | 20-week MA | Break = bull case probability rises to 30% |

### Invalidation Levels
| Condition | Implication | Probability Adjustment |
|-----------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Break below $80K with volume** | Bear case activated | Bear: 40% / Base: 35% / Bull: 25% |
| **Sustained trading below $82K for 2+ weeks** | Extended correction confirmed | Bear: 35% / Base: 45% / Bull: 20% |
| **Failure to reclaim $92K by January 15, 2026** | Delayed recovery scenario | Base case peak shifts to Q4 2026 |
| **Reclaim $97K by year-end** | V-bottom confirmed | Base: 60% / Bull: 30% / Bear: 10% |
| **Whale accumulation data shows distribution** | Smart money exiting | Bear: 50% / Base: 35% / Bull: 15% |

## WEEKLY TRACKING METRICS

### Monitor These Weekly (December 17 - December 24, 2025)

#### Critical Metrics (Check Every Week)
1. **$80K Support Test**
   - Target: HOLD $80,400 at all costs
   - Current: $86,780 (watch closely; $6K cushion remains)
   - Threshold: Break below $80K with volume = bear case 40%, reassess everything

2. **ETF Flows**
   - Target: Outflows slow to <$100M/week by Dec 31
   - Current: Estimated -$100M to -$300M this week
   - Threshold: Accelerating outflows >$500M/week = bear case 35%

3. **MVRV Ratio**
   - Target: Stabilize at 1.8-2.0 (healthy accumulation zone)
   - Current: ~1.85-1.95 (estimated)
   - Threshold: Decline below 1.7 = bear case 30%; below 1.5 = 45%

4. **Fear & Greed Index**
   - Target: Bottom formation at 10-20, then begin recovery
   - Current: Estimated 15-20 (extreme fear)
   - Threshold: Drop below 10 = max capitulation (contrarian buy signal)

5. **Bitcoin Price Action**
   - Target: Hold $80K; reclaim $87K by year-end would be bullish
   - Current: $86,780
   - Threshold: Any daily close below $80K = urgent reassessment required

#### Important Events (Next 7 Days)
- **December 18-20:** Year-end options expiry (potential volatility)
- **December 23-31:** Lightest trading week of year (low liquidity, tax-loss selling peak)
- **December 31:** Tax-loss selling deadline (Jan 2 typically sees buying resume)
- **January 1-3, 2026:** New year positioning (institutional flows typically reverse positive)

#### On-Chain Metrics to Watch
6. **Whale Accumulation**
   - Target: Continued net accumulation >10K BTC/week
   - Current: 47.6K BTC through Dec 10; Dec 11-17 data critical
   - Threshold: Reversal to distribution = bear case 35%

7. **Exchange Balances**
   - Target: Continued outflows (self-custody = bullish)
   - Current: Trend was declining; watch for panic deposits to exchanges
   - Threshold: Surge in exchange inflows = distribution warning

---

## PORTFOLIO ALLOCATION RECOMMENDATION

### Current Portfolio Status
- **Current Allocation:** 36% BTC / 64% USDT
- **Last Action:** DCA buy 1.25% (from Dec 10 analysis which recommended 55/45)
- **Note:** User's allocation (36/64) is more conservative than last week's recommendation (55/45)
- **Last Rebalance:** December 10, 2025 (DCA execution)
- **Days Since Last Action:** 7 days

### RECOMMENDED ACTION: HOLD (Defensive Positioning)

**Target Allocation:** 36% BTC / 64% USDT (maintain current - do NOT add)

**Adjustment Size:** 0% (no rebalancing)

---

### Rationale

**Why HOLD (Not BUY)?**

Your conservative 36/64 allocation is **appropriate and prudent** given this week's breakdown:

#### Bearish/Cautious Factors:
1. **Critical Support Test:** $80K is 7% below current price; high risk of further decline
2. **Technical Breakdown:** Sequential support failures ($92K → $87K) suggest momentum is bearish
3. **Year-End Selling:** Tax-loss harvesting peaks this week; selling pressure likely continues through Dec 31
4. **ETF Outflows Continuing:** Institutional sentiment still uncertain
5. **Uncertainty:** Until $80K is tested and holds, risk/reward is poor for adding exposure

#### Why Not SELL? (Why Stay at 36% BTC):
1. **Extreme Fear = Contrarian Buy Setup:** Fear & Greed ~15-20 historically marks major bottoms
2. **Mid-Cycle Thesis Alive:** $80K must break to invalidate; until then, base case intact
3. **Fed Easing Intact:** Macro trajectory supportive over 6-9 month horizon
4. **Whale Likely Accumulating:** Smart money probably buying at $86K (data from Dec 1-10 showed aggressive accumulation)
5. **Tax-Loss Selling Ends Soon:** Jan 2 typically sees buying resume; current weakness may be temporary
6. **Your Allocation Already Conservative:** 36% provides downside protection while maintaining upside exposure

**Decision:** 36/64 is the RIGHT allocation for this environment. Patient capital waits for:
- $80K to hold (confirms base case)
- January reversal (tax-loss buying resumes)
- Whale accumulation data to confirm smart money buying
- ETF flows to stabilize

**DO NOT ADD** until clearer signals emerge.

---

### DCA Integration

**Base DCA Strategy:**
- **Recommended Monthly Rate:** 5% of USDT allocation into BTC
- **Weekly Equivalent:** ~1.25% of USDT allocation per week
- **This Week's Action:** **PAUSE DCA** (wait for $80K test resolution)

**Tactical Overlay:**
- **This Week:** **SKIP weekly DCA**
- **Reasoning:**
  - $80K test imminent (7% below current price)
  - Better to deploy capital AFTER $80K holds or breaks
  - If $80K holds → resume DCA + tactical add
  - If $80K breaks → wait for $75K or lower to DCA

**Exception - Aggressive Accumulators:**
If you have high risk tolerance and long time horizon (5+ years), you could:
- **DCA this week:** 1.25% of USDT = modest add at $86K
- **Set limit orders:** 2.5% at $82K, 5% at $80K (dollar-cost-average down)
- **Rationale:** Extreme fear + whale accumulation = historically excellent entry zone

**Conservative Recommendation (For Most Users):**
- **This Week:** Skip DCA, hold 36/64
- **Next Week (Post-$80K Test):** Resume DCA if support holds

**Example Calculation (if portfolio = $100,000):**
- Current: $36,000 BTC / $64,000 USDT
- **This Week:** No action (pause DCA due to $80K risk)
- **IF $80K Holds:** Next week resume $64,000 × 0.0125 = $800 weekly DCA

**Guardrails:** ✅ Maintained
- Min BTC Allocation: 10% (currently 36% ✅)
- Max BTC Allocation: 90% (currently 36% ✅)

### Recommended Actions This Week (December 17-24)

1. **✅ Maintain 36/64 allocation** (do nothing)
2. **⏸️ PAUSE weekly DCA** (skip this week; wait for $80K test)
3. **📊 Monitor intensely:**
   - $80K support test (critical)
   - Whale on-chain data (accumulation vs distribution)
   - ETF flows (are outflows slowing?)
   - Fear & Greed Index (bottoming process?)
4. **🔔 Set alerts:**
   - BTC < $82,000 (warning; $80K test imminent)
   - BTC < $80,000 (CRITICAL; reassess immediately)
   - BTC > $87,000 (breakdown negated; bullish)

- **Action:** Continue HOLD
- **Rationale:** Uncertainty remains; wait for resolution

## FINAL ASSESSMENT

### Current Market Phase: **Critical Support Test - Make or Break**

This week marks a **crucial inflection point** for Bitcoin:

⚠️ **Bearish Developments:**
- 7% weekly decline breaking below $87K secondary support
- Technical momentum decidedly bearish
- Year-end tax-loss selling creating forced liquidations
- Post-Fed "sell the news" reaction confirms cautious sentiment
- Next major support at $80K only 7% below current price

✅ **Bull Case Still Alive If $80K Holds:**
- Extreme fear (15-20 Fear & Greed) historically marks major bottoms
- Whale accumulation through Dec 10 suggests smart money buying dips
- Fed easing trajectory intact (today's weakness doesn't change 2026 outlook)
- Mid-cycle thesis valid until $80K breaks
- Tax-loss selling ends Dec 31; Jan typically reverses positive
- MVRV 1.85-1.95 is healthy accumulation zone (not overheated, not bearish)

**Highest Conviction:**
- **If $80K holds:** Bitcoin peaks **September 25, 2026** at **$165,000** with **52% confidence** (lower than last week but still base case)
- **If $80K breaks:** Reassess entirely; bear case rises to 40%, extended correction to $65-75K likely

**Key Changes from Last Week:**
- Confidence decreased from 58% to 52% due to technical breakdown
- Peak date extended 5 days (Sept 20 → Sept 25) to account for extended consolidation
- Target price reduced $3K ($168K → $165K) due to lower starting point
- Bear case probability increased from 15% to 25% (per last week's $87K break framework)
- Bull case probability decreased from 27% to 23% (lower odds of explosive rally near-term)

**What Would Restore Confidence (to 55-58%):**
1. **$80K support holds with conviction** (bounce to $88-90K+)
2. Whale accumulation data confirms smart money buying December dip
3. ETF flows stabilize or reverse positive early January
4. Fear & Greed Index bottoms at 10-15, then begins recovery
5. BTC reclaims $92K by mid-January (confirms V-bottom)

**What Would Collapse Confidence (to <40% base case):**
1. **Break below $80K with volume** (bear case rises to 40%)
2. Sustained trading below $80K for 3+ days
3. Whale accumulation reverses to distribution
4. ETF outflows accelerate to >$500M/week
5. MVRV declines below 1.7

**Next Critical Week:** **THIS WEEK** (Dec 17-24) is the most important of Q4. $80K will be tested. The resolution of this test determines 2026 trajectory.

**Portfolio Stance:**
- **HOLD 36/64** (do nothing)
- **PAUSE DCA** (wait for $80K test outcome)
- **Prepare to act:** IF $80K holds → add 10-15%; IF $80K breaks → reduce 10-15%

**Patience Required:** This is NOT the time to panic sell OR aggressively buy. Wait for resolution. Let the market show its hand at $80K.
