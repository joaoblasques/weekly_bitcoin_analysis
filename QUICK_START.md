## Troubleshooting

**Q: Which AI should I use?**  
A: Claude, ChatGPT, or Gemini all work. Claude is recommended for its web search and file reading capabilities.

**Q: What if the AI can't access web search?**  
A: Manually provide current BTC price and say "use latest available data for on-chain metrics."

**Q: What if I forget my portfolio allocation?**  
A: Check the previous week's analysis or `analysis_tracking.md` - it's recorded there.

**Q: Do I have to execute the portfolio recommendation?**  
A: No! It's optional. You can just track predictions without trading.

**Q: Can I modify the recommendation?**  
A: Yes! Use the recommendation as guidance but adjust based on your risk tolerance.
