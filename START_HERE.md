## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Q: Which AI should I use?**
A: Claude, ChatGPT, or Gemini all work. **Claude is recommended** for web search and file reading capabilities.

**Q: What if the AI can't fetch Bitcoin price?**
A: Manually provide the current BTC price from [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com) or [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com).

**Q: What if AI can't access web search?**
A: Say *"use latest available data for on-chain metrics"* - AI will use most recent known values.

**Q: I forgot my portfolio allocation - where do I find it?**
A: Check your last analysis file or open `analysis_tracking.md` - it's recorded there.

**Q: Do I have to execute the portfolio recommendation?**
A: **No!** It's optional. You can just track predictions without trading.

**Q: Can I modify the recommendation?**
A: **Yes!** Use it as guidance but adjust based on your risk tolerance.

**Q: What if I miss a week?**
A: No problem! Just run the analysis when you can. The system tracks week-over-week changes.
